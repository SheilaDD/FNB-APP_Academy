#Operations on numeric data
# Numeric operations can be performed on numeric data types like integers and floats.
# Here are some examples of basic arithmetic operations:
#x = 10
#y = 2

#print(x + y)  # Addition
#print(x - y)  # Subtraction
#print(x * y)  # Multiplication
#print(x / y)  # Division

#operators with strings
# String operations can be performed on string data types.

str1 = "Hello"
str2 = "World"

# Concatenation
print(str1 + " " + str2)  # Output: Hello World
print(str1 * 3)  # Output: HelloHelloHello
