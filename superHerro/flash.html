      <p>About The Flash</p>
      <p>
        He can move so fast he can travel in time. His nickname is the Scarlet
        Speedster. The Flash is able to pass into other dimensions and parallel
        worlds.The Flash has mastery over not just speed, but time itself, and
        he has often used his powers to travel though different eras and even
        into other dimensions. Although the Flash has not always been fast
        enough to outrun personal tragedy when it has come for him, he always
        does his best to prevent the same from happening to the people of
        Central City and Keystone City. In so doing, he's earned himself a spot
        among the greatest Super Heroes the DC Universe has ever known.
